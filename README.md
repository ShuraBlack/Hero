Hero is based on the classic strategy video game series "Heroes of Might and Magic". 
Our goal is to make a stand alone out of the combat system, in which both main factions, Castle and Inferno fight each other.
This fight represents the epic battle between angels and demons.

The player will controll one of the choisen sides on a tile-like battleground. Each player get 7 unique creatures with
different values, like health points, damage amount, movment speed, etc. to fight until somebody got nothing left.
